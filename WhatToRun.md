To generate a graph of theoretical period lengths, run TheoreticalTime.py in Step 2.
To collect data from the physical pendulum, run logger.py on the micro:bit on the pendulum, and receiver.py on the micro:bit on the computer (both in Step 3). 
Then, to process our collected data, generate graphs of acceleration and theta for each pendulum length, and generate a graph of period length versus pendulum length, run PlotData.py in Step 4. 
To run a pendulum simulation with given lengths, calculate period length, and generate graphs for acceleration, velocity, and position, run PendulumSimulation.py in Step 5. 
To generate the compiled data from the theoretical, collected, and simulated values of period vs length, run CompiledDataLogPlot.py in Step 5.
